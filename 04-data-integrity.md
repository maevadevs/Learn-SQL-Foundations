# Data Integrty

These data integrity exists with each RDBMS

- `Entity Integrity` -- There are no duplicate rows in a table
- `Domain Integrity` -- Enforces valid entries for a given column by restricting the type, format, or range of values
- `Referential Integrity` -- Rows which are used by other records cannot be deleted
- `User-Defined Integrity` -- Enforces some specific business rules that do not fall into entity, domain, or referential integrity
